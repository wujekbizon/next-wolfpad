# Wolfpad - an interactive coding environment

###  You can write Javascript, see it executed, and write comprehensive documentation using built in markdown editor.
 1. The code in each code editor is all joined together into one file. If you define a variable in cell #1, you can refer to it in any following cell! 
 2. You can show any React component, string, number, or anything else
by calling the &lt; show &gt; function. This is a function built into this environment. Call &lt; show &gt;</i> multiple times to show multiple values
3. Re-order or delete cells using the buttons on the top right
4. Add new cells by hovering on the divider between each cell

## New additions to Wolfpad
Recently, I added new features to the app. They can be use as a new cells, in pair with the code editor.
1. Excalidraw
2. OpenAI chatbot
3. Lexical text editor

## #Documentiation 
For now, I'm not planning on adding any documentation , but if need it, this is a place, where will be added.

#### Wolfpad is designed, to work better on desktop , despite this fact, there is a mobile version that is being developed.

## #Future of Wolfpad
There is a company name [SocketSupply](https://github.com/socketsupply), which is currently working on developing an awesome piece of web technology, for helping build peer to peer software. 
So I set my mind to follow this path , to make Wolfpad a peer to peer software, allowing users to share resources and information directly with each other.
